GoKarts script for FiveM made by sati. The resmon for this script is 0.02-0.4ms when idle/next to marker. While the race is ongoing, it is 0.05-0.07ms. To reduce this, feel free to remove all the drawAdvancedNativeText's used as this increases resmon by 0.01-0.03.

How to set different checkpoints?
      Head to the client.lua, and edit/add the previously made checkpoints on line 10-23

How to change the gokart vehicle?
     Head to the config.lua and you will see a vehicleModel setting, put the spawncode inside of the backticks.

UPDATE :

UPDATED server.lua to reset the race if someone while racing crash/connection drop and there's no more player in the race so it make the queue available again for new players.
